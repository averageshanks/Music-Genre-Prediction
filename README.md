**Music Genre Classification using CNN** <br />
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify music genres using the GTZAN dataset. It converts audio files into Mel-spectrograms and trains a deep learning model for classification.

**Features:**
1) Preprocessing: Audio chunking and Mel-spectrogram visualization
2) CNN-based model with multiple convolutional layers
3) Training and evaluation with accuracy/loss visualization
4) Performance metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

**Dataset:**<br />
The model is trained on the GTZAN dataset, which includes 10 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, and Rock.
