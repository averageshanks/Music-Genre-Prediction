Music Genre Classification using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify music genres using the GTZAN dataset. It converts audio files into Mel-spectrograms and trains a deep learning model for classification.

Features
Preprocessing: Audio chunking and Mel-spectrogram visualization
CNN-based model with multiple convolutional layers
Training and evaluation with accuracy/loss visualization
Performance metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
Dataset
The model is trained on the GTZAN dataset, which includes 10 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, and Rock.
